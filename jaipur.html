        <strong>Jaipur</strong> (/ˈdʒaɪpʊər/ ⓘ; Hindi: [ˈdʒeəpʊɾ], also [ˈdʒəjpʊɾ]) is the capital and the largest city of the north-western Indian state of Rajasthan. As of 2011, the city had a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most populous city in the country. Located 268 km (167 miles) from the national capital New Delhi, Jaipur is also known as the Pink City due to the dominant color scheme of its buildings in the old city.[11]    </p>

        Jaipur was founded in 1727 by Sawai Jai Singh II, the Kachhwaha Rajput ruler of Amer, after whom the city is named.[12] It is one of the earliest planned cities of modern India, designed by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya.[13] During the British colonial period, the city served as the capital of Jaipur State. After Indian independence in 1947, Jaipur became the capital of the newly formed state of Rajasthan in 1949.    </p>

On 6 July 2019, the city was named to the World Heritage Cities list.[15] It is also known as Paris of India. Due to its beauty, C.V. Raman called it "Island of Glory".    </p>
